[Gemini] Sending prompt: Given the following study notes, generate 5 multiple-choice quiz (MCQ) questions with 4 options each and the correct answer marked. Respond ONLY as a JSON list of objects with keys: 'question', 'options', 'answer'. Study notes: **Control Flow:**

* **Conditional Statements:**  `if`, `elif`, `else` control execution based on boolean conditions.  Indentation defines code blocks. Example: checking if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
* **Loops:** `for` iterates over sequences (lists, strings). `while` repeats until a condition is false.  `break` exits the loop prematurely. `continue` skips to the next iteration.  Example: printing numbers 1 to 10.

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**

* **Classes:** Blueprints for creating objects. Define attributes (data) and methods (functions). Example: a `Dog` class with attributes `name`, `breed` and a method `bark()`.
* **Objects:** Instances of a class.  Each object has its own set of attribute values.  Example: creating two `Dog` objects, `dog1` and `dog2`, each with different names and breeds.

Given the following study notes, generate 5 multiple-choice quiz (MCQ) questions with 4 options each and the correct answer marked. Respond ONLY as a JSON list of objects with keys: 'question', 'options', 'answer'. Study notes: **Inheritance:**  Establishes "is-a" relationships between classes.  Base class (superclass) provides common attributes/methods. Derived class (subclass) inherits and can extend/override.  `extends` keyword used. Promotes code reuse and organization.

**Polymorphism:** Enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type.  Method overriding (same method signature, different implementation in subclass) is key. Achieved via interfaces or inheritance.  Facilitates flexibility and dynamic behavior.

**Exception Handling:** Mechanism for managing runtime errors.  `try-catch` blocks isolate potentially problematic code.  `try` contains code that might throw an exception.  `catch` handles specific exception types.  `finally` block executes regardless of exception occurrence. Ensures program stability and graceful error handling.

* **Conditional Statements:**  `if`, `elif`, `else` control code execution based on boolean conditions.  Demonstrated with examples checking number parity and comparing values.  Nested conditionals allow for more complex logic.
* **Loops:** `for` loops iterate over sequences (lists, strings). `while` loops execute as long as a condition is true.  Examples include printing list elements and calculating factorials.  `break` and `continue` control loop execution.

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**

* **Classes:** Blueprints for creating objects. Define attributes (data) and methods (behavior). Example: `Dog` class with attributes `name` and `breed`, and method `bark()`.
* **Objects:** Instances of a class. Each dog object has its own unique `name` and `breed`.
* **Inheritance:**  Creating new classes (child classes) based on existing ones (parent classes). Child class inherits parent's attributes and methods, and can add its own. Example: `Poodle` class inheriting from `Dog` class.

**Exceptions:** Errors detected during execution. Handle with `try-except` blocks.  `try` contains code that might raise an exception. `except` specifies how to handle a specific exception type (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`, `TypeError`).  Use `finally` for cleanup (e.g., closing files) regardless of exceptions.  Can raise exceptions manually with `raise`.

**Input/Output:**
* **Reading files:** `open("filename.txt", "r")` opens a file for reading. Methods like `.read()`, `.readline()`, `.readlines()` read file content.  Use `with open(...) as f:` to automatically close the file.
* **Writing files:** `open("filename.txt", "w")` opens a file for writing (overwrites existing content).  `"a"` appends to an existing file. Use `.write()` to write data.
*  Handle potential `IOError` (e.g., file not found) with `try-except`.

Respond ONLY as a JSON list of objects with keys: 'question', 'options', 'answer'. Study notes: **Machine Learning & Data Preprocessing Intro (0:00-2:07)**

Machine Learning: Algorithms learning from data without explicit programming.  Two main types: Supervised (labeled data, prediction) and Unsupervised (unlabeled data, pattern discovery).  Example: Predicting customer churn (supervised).

Data Preprocessing crucial for accurate models.  Steps include:
1. **Handling Missing Values:** Deletion (rows/columns), imputation (mean/median).
2. **Categorical Feature Encoding:** Converting text to numbers. One-Hot Encoding for nominal data (no order), Label Encoding for ordinal data (ordered categories).
3. **Feature Scaling:**  Bringing features to similar scales prevents features with larger values dominating. Two common methods: Normalization (0-1 range) and Standardization (mean 0, standard deviation 1).
4. **Data Splitting:**  Training set (model learning), Testing set (evaluation).
These steps improve model performance and prevent biases.

[Gemini] Sending prompt: Given the following study notes, generate 5 multiple-choice quiz (MCQ) questions with 4 options each and the correct answer marked. Respond ONLY as a JSON list of objects with keys: 'question', 'options', 'answer'. Study notes: Supervised Learning uses labeled data to train algorithms.  Regression predicts continuous values (e.g., house prices).  Cost function measures prediction error.  Gradient descent minimizes cost by iteratively adjusting model parameters.  Learning rate controls step size.  Classification predicts discrete categories (e.g., spam/not spam). Logistic regression uses sigmoid function to output probability.  Decision boundary separates classes.  Support Vector Machines (SVMs) find optimal hyperplane maximizing margin. Kernel trick handles non-linearly separable data by mapping to higher dimensions.  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifies based on proximity to labeled data points.  Overfitting occurs when model performs well on training data but poorly on new data.  Regularization (L1/L2) penalizes large weights to prevent overfitting.

**Clustering:** Grouping similar data points. K-Means: iterative algorithm, minimizes within-cluster variance.  Elbow method and silhouette analysis help determine optimal 'k'. Challenges include specifying 'k', sensitivity to initialization, and varying cluster shapes.

**Dimensionality Reduction:** Reduces data complexity while preserving essential information. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): finds orthogonal components maximizing variance. Explained variance ratio helps determine number of components to keep.  Useful for visualization, noise reduction, and feature engineering.

**Model Evaluation (Unsupervised):** Lack of ground truth makes evaluation complex. Internal measures like silhouette coefficient assess cluster cohesion and separation. External measures require labeled data (partially labeled datasets can be used).  Visualizations aid qualitative assessment.  Focus on stability, interpretability, and downstream task performance.

Respond ONLY as a JSON list of objects with keys: 'question', 'options', 'answer'. Study notes: Machine Learning (ML) teaches computers to learn from data without explicit programming.  Two main types: Supervised (labeled data, predicting outcomes like spam/not spam) and Unsupervised (unlabeled data, finding patterns like customer segmentation). Data preprocessing is crucial for effective ML.  It involves: 1) Importing libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy). 2) Importing the dataset (e.g., CSV file). 3) Handling missing data (replace with mean/median or delete rows/columns).  4) Encoding categorical data (convert text categories to numbers using Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding). 5) Splitting data into training and test sets (e.g., 80/20 split). 6) Feature scaling (standardization or normalization to bring features to a similar scale).  These steps prepare data for optimal model training.

[Gemini] Sending prompt: Given the following study notes, generate 5 multiple-choice quiz (MCQ) questions with 4 options each and the correct answer marked. Respond ONLY as a JSON list of objects with keys: 'question', 'options', 'answer'. Study notes: Supervised Learning uses labeled data (input-output pairs) to train models.  Regression predicts continuous output values. Example: predicting house prices based on features like size, location.  Cost function measures prediction error (e.g., Mean Squared Error). Gradient descent iteratively adjusts model parameters to minimize cost.  Classification predicts discrete categories. Example: classifying emails as spam/not spam. Logistic regression uses a sigmoid function to output probabilities for each class.  Decision boundary separates different classes.  Evaluation metrics for classification include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  Overfitting occurs when the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data. Regularization techniques (L1, L2) help prevent overfitting by penalizing large model parameters.

Respond ONLY as a JSON list of objects with keys: 'question', 'options', 'answer'. Study notes: **Exception Handling:** Java uses `try-catch` blocks to handle exceptions.  `try` contains code that might throw an exception, `catch` handles specific exception types.  `finally` block executes regardless of exceptions, useful for cleanup (e.g., closing files).  Checked exceptions are handled at compile time, unchecked at runtime.

**Input/Output:** Java uses streams for I/O.  `FileInputStream` and `FileOutputStream` for file operations.  `BufferedReader` and `BufferedWriter` for buffered reading/writing, improving efficiency.  `Scanner` class simplifies input from various sources.

**Collections Framework:**  Provides interfaces and classes for working with groups of objects.  `List` (ordered, allows duplicates), `Set` (no duplicates), `Map` (key-value pairs).  `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap` are common implementations.  Iterators used to traverse collections.

[Gemini] Sending prompt: Given the following study notes, generate 5 multiple-choice quiz (MCQ) questions with 4 options each and the correct answer marked. Respond ONLY as a JSON list of objects with keys: 'question', 'options', 'answer'. Study notes: Processes are independent execution environments with own memory space. Threads are lightweight units of execution within a process, sharing the same memory.  Process scheduling manages CPU allocation to processes.  Common algorithms include First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF, non-preemptive), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF, preemptive), Priority Scheduling (preemptive or non-preemptive), and Round Robin (preemptive, time-sliced).  Context switching saves and restores process state for efficient switching.  Schedulers aim for fairness, low response time, high throughput, and minimal waiting time.  Long-term scheduler controls degree of multiprogramming by deciding which programs to admit. Short-term scheduler selects ready processes for CPU. Mid-term scheduler swaps processes out to reduce multiprogramming.

[Gemini] Sending prompt: Given the following study notes, generate 5 theory assignment questions (open-ended, descriptive). Respond ONLY as a JSON list of strings. Study notes: Processes are independent execution environments with own memory space. Threads are lightweight units of execution within a process, sharing the same memory.  Process scheduling manages CPU allocation to processes.  Common algorithms include First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF, non-preemptive), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF, preemptive), Priority Scheduling (preemptive or non-preemptive), and Round Robin (preemptive, time-sliced).  Context switching saves and restores process state for efficient switching.  Schedulers aim for fairness, low response time, high throughput, and minimal waiting time.  Long-term scheduler controls degree of multiprogramming by deciding which programs to admit. Short-term scheduler selects ready processes for CPU. Mid-term scheduler swaps processes out to reduce multiprogramming.

[Gemini] Sending prompt: Given the following study notes, generate 5 multiple-choice quiz (MCQ) questions with 4 options each and the correct answer marked. Respond ONLY as a JSON list of objects with keys: 'question', 'options', 'answer'. Study notes: Processes and Threads:

Processes are independent execution environments with their own memory space. They are heavyweight in terms of creation and context switching.  Threads exist within a process and share the process's memory space. This allows for efficient communication and resource sharing but introduces potential concurrency issues. Threads are lightweight, making creation and switching faster.  A process has at least one thread (the main thread). Multithreading allows parallel execution within a process, utilizing multiple CPU cores.  Inter-process communication (IPC) is more complex than inter-thread communication, requiring mechanisms like pipes or shared memory.  Context switching between threads is faster than between processes as fewer resources need to be swapped.

[Gemini] Sending prompt: Given the following study notes, generate 5 multiple-choice quiz (MCQ) questions with 4 options each and the correct answer marked. Respond ONLY as a JSON list of objects with keys: 'question', 'options', 'answer'. Study notes: Case studies illustrate architectural trade-offs.  Linux prioritizes modularity and portability through a monolithic kernel with loadable modules.  This allows flexibility and hardware support but can lead to complex driver management and potential instability with faulty modules. Windows prioritizes performance and backward compatibility with a hybrid kernel, combining microkernel concepts and monolithic structure. This provides efficient resource management and robust driver model but sacrifices some portability and can lead to a larger kernel footprint.  Microkernel architectures, like Mach (used in early Mac OS X versions), emphasize stability and security by minimizing kernel responsibilities.  However, inter-process communication overhead can hinder performance.  The choice depends on the system's primary goals.

```

[Gemini] Sending prompt: Given the following study notes, generate 5 theory assignment questions (open-ended, descriptive). Respond ONLY as a JSON list of strings. Study notes: Case studies illustrate architectural trade-offs.  Linux prioritizes modularity and portability through a monolithic kernel with loadable modules.  This allows flexibility and hardware support but can lead to complex driver management and potential instability with faulty modules. Windows prioritizes performance and backward compatibility with a hybrid kernel, combining microkernel concepts and monolithic structure. This provides efficient resource management and robust driver model but sacrifices some portability and can lead to a larger kernel footprint.  Microkernel architectures, like Mach (used in early Mac OS X versions), emphasize stability and security by minimizing kernel responsibilities.  However, inter-process communication overhead can hinder performance.  The choice depends on the system's primary goals.

Respond ONLY as a JSON list of objects with keys: 'question', 'options', 'answer'. Study notes: Control Flow in Python manages execution order.  `if/else` statements enable conditional execution. `if` a condition is true, its block executes; `else` handles the false case.  `elif` (else if) chains multiple conditions. Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) form conditions. Indentation defines code blocks.

Nested loops are possible.  Proper indentation is crucial for control flow.

Testing ensures code works as expected, catching errors early.  Use `assert` statements to check for specific conditions during development.  `assert condition, message` raises an `AssertionError` if the condition is false, displaying the message. Example: `assert x > 0, "x must be positive"`.  Debugging involves finding and fixing errors.  Print statements help trace variable values and program flow.  Interactive debuggers like `pdb` (Python Debugger) allow stepping through code, setting breakpoints, inspecting variables, and more.  `pdb.set_trace()` initiates the debugger.  Common errors include `SyntaxError`, `TypeError`, `NameError`, and `IndexError`.  Reading error messages carefully helps pinpoint the issue's location and cause.

Use `assert` statements to check for specific conditions during development.  `assert condition, message` raises an `AssertionError` if the condition is false, displaying the message. Example: `assert x > 0, "x must be positive"`.  Debugging involves finding and fixing errors.  Print statements help trace variable values and program flow.  Interactive debuggers like `pdb` (Python Debugger) allow stepping through code, setting breakpoints, inspecting variables, and more.  `pdb.set_trace()` initiates the debugger.  Common errors include `SyntaxError`, `TypeError`, `NameError`, and `IndexError`.  Reading error messages carefully helps pinpoint the issue's location and cause.

**Primitive Data Types:**  `int` (integers), `double` (floating-point numbers), `char` (single characters), `boolean` (true/false).  `byte`, `short`, `long`, `float` also exist but less common.

**Variables:**  Declare using `type variableName = value;`. Example: `int age = 30;`.  Variables store data. Choose appropriate data type.

**Operators:**
* **Arithmetic:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (modulo).  Order of operations applies.
* **Assignment:** `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`.  Shorthand for updating variables.
* **Comparison:** `==` (equal to), `!=` (not equal to), `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.  Result is boolean.
* **Logical:** `&&` (and), `||` (or), `!` (not). Used for combining boolean expressions.

Remember to use semicolons (`;`) to end statements.

[Gemini] Sending prompt: Given the following study notes, generate 5 multiple-choice quiz (MCQ) questions with 4 options each and the correct answer marked. Respond ONLY as a JSON list of objects with keys: 'question', 'options', 'answer'. Study notes: **Control Flow (Python)**

**Conditional Statements:**  `if`, `elif`, `else` control code execution based on boolean conditions.  Indentation defines code blocks.  Conditions use comparison operators (e.g., `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) and logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`).  Example:  `if x > 5: print("x is greater than 5")`.

**Loops:** Repeat code blocks.  `for` loop iterates over a sequence (e.g., list, string, range). Example: `for i in range(5): print(i)`.  `while` loop repeats as long as a condition is true. Example: `x = 0; while x < 5: print(x); x += 1`.  `break` statement exits the loop prematurely. `continue` skips to the next iteration. Nested loops are possible.

Respond ONLY as a JSON list of objects with keys: 'question', 'options', 'answer'. Study notes: **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts (04:00:00-06:00:00)**

**Classes:** Blueprints for creating objects. Define attributes (data) and methods (behavior). Example: `class Dog { string name; void bark() { } }`.

**Objects:** Instances of a class. Concrete realizations with specific values for attributes.  Example: `Dog myDog = new Dog(); myDog.name = "Fido"; myDog.bark();`

**Inheritance:**  Creating new classes (derived classes) based on existing ones (base classes). Inherits attributes and methods, promoting code reuse. Example: `class Poodle : Dog { void groom() { } }`. Poodle inherits name and bark from Dog.

**Polymorphism:**  Objects of different classes can respond to the same method call in their own specific way. Achieved through method overriding (redefining a base class method in a derived class). Example: Both `Dog` and `Poodle` have `bark()`, but a `Poodle` might have a higher-pitched bark. Enables flexible and extensible code.

[Gemini] Sending prompt: Given the following study notes, generate 5 multiple-choice quiz (MCQ) questions with 4 options each and the correct answer marked. Respond ONLY as a JSON list of objects with keys: 'question', 'options', 'answer'. Study notes: Machine learning (ML) allows computers to learn from data without explicit programming.  It's a subset of AI focusing on building systems that improve performance on a specific task through experience. Two main types of ML are supervised (labeled data, predicting outcomes like housing prices) and unsupervised (unlabeled data, finding patterns like customer segmentation).  ML algorithms learn from data, building a model.  New data is then inputted, and the model makes predictions or identifies patterns. Applications are widespread, including spam filtering, fraud detection, medical diagnosis, personalized recommendations, and self-driving cars.  Deep learning, a subfield of ML, uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to analyze complex data like images and speech.

[Gemini] Sending prompt: Given the following study notes, generate 5 theory assignment questions (open-ended, descriptive). Respond ONLY as a JSON list of strings. Study notes: Machine learning (ML) allows computers to learn from data without explicit programming.  It's a subset of AI focusing on building systems that improve performance on a specific task through experience. Two main types of ML are supervised (labeled data, predicting outcomes like housing prices) and unsupervised (unlabeled data, finding patterns like customer segmentation).  ML algorithms learn from data, building a model.  New data is then inputted, and the model makes predictions or identifies patterns. Applications are widespread, including spam filtering, fraud detection, medical diagnosis, personalized recommendations, and self-driving cars.  Deep learning, a subfield of ML, uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to analyze complex data like images and speech.

[Gemini] Sending prompt: Given the following study notes, generate 5 multiple-choice quiz (MCQ) questions with 4 options each and the correct answer marked. Respond ONLY as a JSON list of objects with keys: 'question', 'options', 'answer'. Study notes: **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering for Tabular Data**

* **Missing Values:** Handle using deletion (rows or columns), imputation (mean/median/mode, KNN), or model-based imputation.  Consider the missingness mechanism (MCAR, MAR, MNAR).
* **Categorical Features:** Convert to numerical using one-hot encoding for nominal data (unordered categories) or ordinal encoding for ordered categories. Target encoding can be useful but prone to overfitting.
* **Numerical Features:** Scale using standardization (Z-score normalization) or min-max scaling.  Consider transformations like log transform for skewed data.
* **Feature Engineering:** Create new features from existing ones.  Examples include combining features (e.g., ratios, sums), extracting date/time features, or using domain expertise.
* **Outliers:** Detect using box plots, scatter plots, or statistical methods. Handle via removal, capping, or transformation.
* **Feature Selection:**  Reduce dimensionality using techniques like filter methods (correlation, variance), wrapper methods (recursive feature elimination), or embedded methods (LASSO, Ridge).

[Gemini] Sending prompt: Given the following study notes, generate 5 multiple-choice quiz (MCQ) questions with 4 options each and the correct answer marked. Respond ONLY as a JSON list of objects with keys: 'question', 'options', 'answer'. Study notes: **Control Flow:**  Uses keywords like `if`, `elif`, and `else` for conditional execution.  `for` and `while` loops manage repeated code blocks.  `break` exits a loop prematurely, `continue` skips to the next iteration.  Indentation is crucial for defining code blocks.

**Functions:**  Defined using `def` keyword followed by a name, parentheses for arguments, and a colon.  Reusable blocks of code promoting modularity.  `return` statement sends a value back to the caller.  Docstrings (triple quotes) explain the function's purpose.

**Modules:**  Files containing Python code (`.py` extension).  Enable code organization and reuse.  Import modules using `import` or `from ... import ...`.  Standard library provides pre-built modules for various tasks (e.g., `math`, `os`, `random`).

[Gemini] Sending prompt: Given the following study notes, generate 5 multiple-choice quiz (MCQ) questions with 4 options each and the correct answer marked. Respond ONLY as a JSON list of objects with keys: 'question', 'options', 'answer'. Study notes: Python is case-sensitive.  Use `print()` for output. Variables are dynamically typed, assigned with `=`. Key data types include integers (e.g., `x = 10`), floats (e.g., `y = 3.14`), strings (e.g., `name = "Alice"` - use single or double quotes), and booleans (`True`/`False`). Basic arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (modulo), `**` (exponentiation), `//` (floor division). Comparison operators: `==` (equality), `!=` (inequality), `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`. Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`. Use `#` for single-line comments.  Code blocks are indented using spaces (typically 4).

[Gemini] Sending prompt: Given the following study notes, generate 5 multiple-choice quiz (MCQ) questions with 4 options each and the correct answer marked. Respond ONLY as a JSON list of objects with keys: 'question', 'options', 'answer'. Study notes: **Python Basics: Syntax, Data Types, Operators**

* **Syntax:** Uses indentation (spaces/tabs) to define code blocks. No semicolons needed. Case-sensitive.  Comments start with `#`.
* **Data Types:**  Integers (`int`), Floats (`float`), Strings (`str` - enclosed in single or double quotes), Booleans (`bool` - `True` or `False`).
* **Type Conversion:**  `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, `bool()`.
* **Operators:**
    * Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//` (floor division), `%` (modulo), `**` (exponentiation).
    * Comparison: `==` (equal to), `!=` (not equal to), `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.
    * Logical: `and`, `or`, `not`.
    * Assignment: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, etc.
* **Print Function:** `print()` displays output.  Can use f-strings for formatted output (e.g., `print(f"Value: {variable}")`).

[Gemini] Sending prompt: Given the following study notes, generate 5 theory assignment questions (open-ended, descriptive). Respond ONLY as a JSON list of strings. Study notes: **Python Basics: Syntax, Data Types, Operators**

* **Syntax:** Uses indentation (spaces/tabs) to define code blocks. No semicolons needed. Case-sensitive.  Comments start with `#`.
* **Data Types:**  Integers (`int`), Floats (`float`), Strings (`str` - enclosed in single or double quotes), Booleans (`bool` - `True` or `False`).
* **Type Conversion:**  `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, `bool()`.
* **Operators:**
    * Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//` (floor division), `%` (modulo), `**` (exponentiation).
    * Comparison: `==` (equal to), `!=` (not equal to), `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.
    * Logical: `and`, `or`, `not`.
    * Assignment: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, etc.
* **Print Function:** `print()` displays output.  Can use f-strings for formatted output (e.g., `print(f"Value: {variable}")`).

[Gemini] Sending prompt: Given the following study notes, generate 5 multiple-choice quiz (MCQ) questions with 4 options each and the correct answer marked. Respond ONLY as a JSON list of objects with keys: 'question', 'options', 'answer'. Study notes: **Control Flow & OOP in Python**

Control flow manages execution order.  `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements handle conditional logic.  Loops (`for`, `while`) repeat code blocks. `for` iterates over sequences; `while` continues until a condition is false. `break` exits a loop prematurely, `continue` skips to the next iteration.

OOP uses objects with data (attributes) and actions (methods).  Classes are blueprints for objects.  Encapsulation bundles data and methods that operate on it.  Inheritance allows new classes (child classes) to inherit properties from existing ones (parent classes), promoting code reuse and extensibility. Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type.

**Classes:** Blueprints for creating objects. Define attributes (data) and methods (behavior).  Example: `class Dog {String name; void bark(){}}`.

**Objects:** Instances of a class.  Each object has its own state (values for attributes). Example: `Dog myDog = new Dog(); myDog.name = "Fido"; myDog.bark();`.

**Inheritance:** Creates new classes (child classes) based on existing ones (parent classes). Child classes inherit attributes and methods from the parent, and can add or modify them. Promotes code reusability. Example: `class Poodle extends Dog {void groom(){}}`. Poodle inherits `name` and `bark()` from Dog.

[Gemini] Sending prompt: Given the following study notes, generate 5 multiple-choice quiz (MCQ) questions with 4 options each and the correct answer marked. Respond ONLY as a JSON list of objects with keys: 'question', 'options', 'answer'. Study notes: **Input/Output:** Python uses `input()` to get user input (always as a string). `print()` displays output.  Files are handled with `open()`, modes like "r" (read), "w" (write), "a" (append). Use `with open(...) as f:` to ensure file closure.  Read line by line with `f.readline()` or whole file with `f.read()`. Write with `f.write()`.

**Collections:** Lists are mutable, ordered sequences using `[]`. Tuples are immutable using `()`. Dictionaries store key-value pairs using `{}`. Sets are unordered, unique collections using `{}` or `set()`.

**Exception Handling:** `try...except` blocks manage errors.  `try` contains code that might raise an exception. `except` specifies exception type to catch and handles it.  `finally` block executes regardless of exceptions, often for cleanup.  `raise` explicitly throws an exception.

A class is a blueprint for creating objects.  Objects are instances of a class. For example, \'Dog\' is a class and \'Fido\' is an object (instance) of class \'Dog\'. Inheritance allows a class (subclass/derived class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (superclass/base class), promoting code reuse and extensibility (e.g., \'Poodle\' inherits from \'Dog\'). Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type.  This enables flexibility, as a single interface can interact with objects of various classes (e.g., both \'Poodle\' and \'GoldenRetriever\' respond to method \'bark()\', albeit differently, using method overriding)."}\nFormat as JSON with keys: \'question\', \'options\' (array), \'answer\''}]}], 'generationConfig': {'response_mime_type': 'application/json'}}
