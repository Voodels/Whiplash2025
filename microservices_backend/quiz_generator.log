[Gemini] Sending prompt: Given the following study notes, generate 5 multiple-choice quiz (MCQ) questions with 4 options each and the correct answer marked. Respond ONLY as a JSON list of objects with keys: 'question', 'options', 'answer'. Study notes: **Control Flow:**

* **Conditional Statements:**  `if`, `elif`, `else` control execution based on boolean conditions.  Indentation defines code blocks. Example: checking if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
* **Loops:** `for` iterates over sequences (lists, strings). `while` repeats until a condition is false.  `break` exits the loop prematurely. `continue` skips to the next iteration.  Example: printing numbers 1 to 10.

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**

* **Classes:** Blueprints for creating objects. Define attributes (data) and methods (functions). Example: a `Dog` class with attributes `name`, `breed` and a method `bark()`.
* **Objects:** Instances of a class.  Each object has its own set of attribute values.  Example: creating two `Dog` objects, `dog1` and `dog2`, each with different names and breeds.

Given the following study notes, generate 5 multiple-choice quiz (MCQ) questions with 4 options each and the correct answer marked. Respond ONLY as a JSON list of objects with keys: 'question', 'options', 'answer'. Study notes: **Inheritance:**  Establishes "is-a" relationships between classes.  Base class (superclass) provides common attributes/methods. Derived class (subclass) inherits and can extend/override.  `extends` keyword used. Promotes code reuse and organization.

**Polymorphism:** Enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type.  Method overriding (same method signature, different implementation in subclass) is key. Achieved via interfaces or inheritance.  Facilitates flexibility and dynamic behavior.

**Exception Handling:** Mechanism for managing runtime errors.  `try-catch` blocks isolate potentially problematic code.  `try` contains code that might throw an exception.  `catch` handles specific exception types.  `finally` block executes regardless of exception occurrence. Ensures program stability and graceful error handling.

* **Conditional Statements:**  `if`, `elif`, `else` control code execution based on boolean conditions.  Demonstrated with examples checking number parity and comparing values.  Nested conditionals allow for more complex logic.
* **Loops:** `for` loops iterate over sequences (lists, strings). `while` loops execute as long as a condition is true.  Examples include printing list elements and calculating factorials.  `break` and `continue` control loop execution.

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**

* **Classes:** Blueprints for creating objects. Define attributes (data) and methods (behavior). Example: `Dog` class with attributes `name` and `breed`, and method `bark()`.
* **Objects:** Instances of a class. Each dog object has its own unique `name` and `breed`.
* **Inheritance:**  Creating new classes (child classes) based on existing ones (parent classes). Child class inherits parent's attributes and methods, and can add its own. Example: `Poodle` class inheriting from `Dog` class.

**Exceptions:** Errors detected during execution. Handle with `try-except` blocks.  `try` contains code that might raise an exception. `except` specifies how to handle a specific exception type (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`, `TypeError`).  Use `finally` for cleanup (e.g., closing files) regardless of exceptions.  Can raise exceptions manually with `raise`.

**Input/Output:**
* **Reading files:** `open("filename.txt", "r")` opens a file for reading. Methods like `.read()`, `.readline()`, `.readlines()` read file content.  Use `with open(...) as f:` to automatically close the file.
* **Writing files:** `open("filename.txt", "w")` opens a file for writing (overwrites existing content).  `"a"` appends to an existing file. Use `.write()` to write data.
*  Handle potential `IOError` (e.g., file not found) with `try-except`.

Respond ONLY as a JSON list of objects with keys: 'question', 'options', 'answer'. Study notes: **Machine Learning & Data Preprocessing Intro (0:00-2:07)**

Machine Learning: Algorithms learning from data without explicit programming.  Two main types: Supervised (labeled data, prediction) and Unsupervised (unlabeled data, pattern discovery).  Example: Predicting customer churn (supervised).

Data Preprocessing crucial for accurate models.  Steps include:
1. **Handling Missing Values:** Deletion (rows/columns), imputation (mean/median).
2. **Categorical Feature Encoding:** Converting text to numbers. One-Hot Encoding for nominal data (no order), Label Encoding for ordinal data (ordered categories).
3. **Feature Scaling:**  Bringing features to similar scales prevents features with larger values dominating. Two common methods: Normalization (0-1 range) and Standardization (mean 0, standard deviation 1).
4. **Data Splitting:**  Training set (model learning), Testing set (evaluation).
These steps improve model performance and prevent biases.

[Gemini] Sending prompt: Given the following study notes, generate 5 multiple-choice quiz (MCQ) questions with 4 options each and the correct answer marked. Respond ONLY as a JSON list of objects with keys: 'question', 'options', 'answer'. Study notes: Supervised Learning uses labeled data to train algorithms.  Regression predicts continuous values (e.g., house prices).  Cost function measures prediction error.  Gradient descent minimizes cost by iteratively adjusting model parameters.  Learning rate controls step size.  Classification predicts discrete categories (e.g., spam/not spam). Logistic regression uses sigmoid function to output probability.  Decision boundary separates classes.  Support Vector Machines (SVMs) find optimal hyperplane maximizing margin. Kernel trick handles non-linearly separable data by mapping to higher dimensions.  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifies based on proximity to labeled data points.  Overfitting occurs when model performs well on training data but poorly on new data.  Regularization (L1/L2) penalizes large weights to prevent overfitting.

**Clustering:** Grouping similar data points. K-Means: iterative algorithm, minimizes within-cluster variance.  Elbow method and silhouette analysis help determine optimal 'k'. Challenges include specifying 'k', sensitivity to initialization, and varying cluster shapes.

**Dimensionality Reduction:** Reduces data complexity while preserving essential information. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): finds orthogonal components maximizing variance. Explained variance ratio helps determine number of components to keep.  Useful for visualization, noise reduction, and feature engineering.

**Model Evaluation (Unsupervised):** Lack of ground truth makes evaluation complex. Internal measures like silhouette coefficient assess cluster cohesion and separation. External measures require labeled data (partially labeled datasets can be used).  Visualizations aid qualitative assessment.  Focus on stability, interpretability, and downstream task performance.

[Gemini] Sending prompt: Given the following study notes, generate 5 multiple-choice quiz (MCQ) questions with 4 options each and the correct answer marked. Respond ONLY as a JSON list of objects with keys: 'question', 'options', 'answer'. Study notes: Machine Learning (ML) teaches computers to learn from data without explicit programming.  Two main types: Supervised (labeled data, predicting outcomes like spam/not spam) and Unsupervised (unlabeled data, finding patterns like customer segmentation). Data preprocessing is crucial for effective ML.  It involves: 1) Importing libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy). 2) Importing the dataset (e.g., CSV file). 3) Handling missing data (replace with mean/median or delete rows/columns).  4) Encoding categorical data (convert text categories to numbers using Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding). 5) Splitting data into training and test sets (e.g., 80/20 split). 6) Feature scaling (standardization or normalization to bring features to a similar scale).  These steps prepare data for optimal model training.

[Gemini] Sending prompt: Given the following study notes, generate 5 multiple-choice quiz (MCQ) questions with 4 options each and the correct answer marked. Respond ONLY as a JSON list of objects with keys: 'question', 'options', 'answer'. Study notes: Supervised Learning uses labeled data (input-output pairs) to train models.  Regression predicts continuous output values. Example: predicting house prices based on features like size, location.  Cost function measures prediction error (e.g., Mean Squared Error). Gradient descent iteratively adjusts model parameters to minimize cost.  Classification predicts discrete categories. Example: classifying emails as spam/not spam. Logistic regression uses a sigmoid function to output probabilities for each class.  Decision boundary separates different classes.  Evaluation metrics for classification include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  Overfitting occurs when the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data. Regularization techniques (L1, L2) help prevent overfitting by penalizing large model parameters.

[Gemini] Sending prompt: Given the following study notes, generate 5 multiple-choice quiz (MCQ) questions with 4 options each and the correct answer marked. Respond ONLY as a JSON list of objects with keys: 'question', 'options', 'answer'. Study notes: **Exception Handling:** Java uses `try-catch` blocks to handle exceptions.  `try` contains code that might throw an exception, `catch` handles specific exception types.  `finally` block executes regardless of exceptions, useful for cleanup (e.g., closing files).  Checked exceptions are handled at compile time, unchecked at runtime.

**Input/Output:** Java uses streams for I/O.  `FileInputStream` and `FileOutputStream` for file operations.  `BufferedReader` and `BufferedWriter` for buffered reading/writing, improving efficiency.  `Scanner` class simplifies input from various sources.

**Collections Framework:**  Provides interfaces and classes for working with groups of objects.  `List` (ordered, allows duplicates), `Set` (no duplicates), `Map` (key-value pairs).  `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap` are common implementations.  Iterators used to traverse collections.
